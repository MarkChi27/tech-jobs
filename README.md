# Personal Project - "Tech Jobs"

This is a job listing website with CRUD features using React, JavaScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and JSON Server.

Note that you need to install JSON server package to run this on your local host properly. The command is below:
```
npm install json-server
```
You can add -D (developer option) to this command if you want.

```npm run dev``` is for running the website at port 3000,
```npm run server``` is for starting the JSON server at port 8000
